# grompt

This is a silly project focused on the terminal prompt for any shell (I guess). I made this because I was bored and I think [starship.rs](https://starship.rs/) is shit and bloated.

So, this prompt is fully made in go without deps. The config is kinda tedious but it's simple and powerful

# Install

If u want to clone the repo and build it, you can use the [makefile](./makefile).

## Local-install

This command installs automatically grompt in `~/.local/bin`

```bash 
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Esteban528/grompt/refs/heads/master/install.sh | bash
